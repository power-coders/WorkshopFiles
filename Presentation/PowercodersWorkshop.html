          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What will we do today?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>We will install a text editor.</li>
            <li>Learn something about Web Development.</li>
            <li>Do our first Website.</li>
            <li>Change a existing Website.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Text Editor</h2>
          <p>A text editor is a program that has additional features that allow for nicer programming.
            This includes syntax highlighting, syntax check, text completion and so on.
            There are a lot of text editors. We will use VSCode. You can find it here:
            <a href="https://bit.ly/32M4xLK">bit.ly/32M4xLK</a> <small>(Or google vscode)</small>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>Web Devolpment has two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: How the Website looks and behaves.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend</strong>: How to save, process and deliever data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will not do any Backend today.</p>
        </section>
          
        <section>
          <h2>Frontend</h2>
          <p>In Frontend Development there are three parts you need to master.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML: Defines the content</li>
            <li>CSS: Styles the content</li>
            <li>Javascript: Interactivity of the content</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can thik of it like a body; HTML is the skeleton; CSS the skin and hair; JS are the muscles.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <p>HTML is not a programming language but a <strong>Markup</strong> Language. 
            In a Markup Language you can define the different elements with tags.
            This way our browser can differentiate between text and other elements. 
            <!-- Elements include text, headings, lists, images, input fields and the list goes on.  --></p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <pre class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1"><code>&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
          <p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
            As you can see you need a opening tag then you define the content and then the closing tag.</p>
          <pre class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2"><code>&lt;a href="www.duck.com"&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
          <p class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2">We can define additional information in the opening tag. 
            In this case we defined where a hyperlink should point to.</p>
        </section> 
        <section>
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheet. With CSS you can style every element as you wish. 
            Most essential you can change size, color and position of elements.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>CSS</h2>
          <p>Here you see a css example: </p>
          <pre><code>p {
  font-size: 1.9 rem;
  color: red;
} </code></pre>
        <p>There are two parts to this. Before the brackets we declare which elements should be themed. 
          In this case all p elements are themed. In side the brackets we specify the theming. 
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Create your website</h2>
          <p>Open the text editor.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Bigger projects</h2>
          <p>You created your first website, <strong>Congratulations!</strong><br>
            We prepared a website for you to experiment with. You find it here:
            <a href="https://github.com/Powercoders-ZRH/WorkshopZRHforTsri">bit.ly/2N9P55q</a>
            <br>On there you also find this presentation.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>As you can see we have our html file and then we have additional folders. 
            It is recommended to seperate the three parts of your code to keep the overview.</p>
            With these lines in the HTML file we link them all toghether.
            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/powercoders.css"&gt;
              ... 
&lt;script src="js/scripts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>HTML structure</h2>
          <p>The HTML file also has a structure. First you find the header. 
            In the header you find infromation about the website, you also find stylesheets.
            After the header there is the body, there we define the elements.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <p>Javascript is a high-level programming language. You can do anything with Javascript. 
            Javascript is built to interact with the HTML elements. 
            Most importantly you can change style and content of elements.
            This makes it possible to add interactivity to a website.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <section>
              <h2 style="float:left;">Programming</h2> 
              <ul>
                <li>Programming is the art of breaking a problem down into smaller problems.</li>
                <li>Finding the solutions to these smaller problems.</li>
                <li>Putting these pieces back together.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Building blocks of Programming:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Variables</li>
                <li>Conditions</li>
                <li>Loops</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
              </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Variables</h2>
              <p>Variables are the way we store and access data in programming.
                We can store simple things like numbers, strings (text) but also mor complex like objects and arrays.</p>
              <pre><code>let Programming = 'nice';
let numberOfHouses = 542;
let numberOfPersonsLivingInHouses = 2.5 * numberOfHouses;</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Conditions</h2>
              <p>Conditions is the way we steer the program. <br>
              A condition is for example if the weather is nice then go outside else stay inside.</p>
              <pre><code>if(weather == 'nice'){
    goOutside();
} else {
  stayInside();
}</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>Loops</h2>
              <p>With Loops our programms get really powerful, It is a way to run lines of code as often as you want.
                An example would be: As long as the music is playing draw circles.
                We have a condition
                There are a few loop options available. We will have a look at the most used one the for loop.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section>
              <h2>For-Loop</h2>
              <p>The For-Loop has three part, the initialization which is only done one time ate the beginning, 
                then the condition which determines when to stop and then there is a command that gets executed every loop we make. </p>
                <pre><code>for(let index = 0; index &lt; 100; index = index + 1){
    drawCircle();
} </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are a block of code to perform a particular task.
              Once you defined a function you can call them to perfrom this task.
              They can accept value and can return one value.</p>
              <pre><code>function sumTwoNumbers(a, b){
    return a+b;
}</code></pre>    
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Examples</h2>
          <p>This was only the beginning. Here are some examples that use the web to deliver a beautiful experience.</p>
          <ul>

          <h2>Tips and how to continue</h2>
          <p>We all agree that the best way to learn programming is to do it.
